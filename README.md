# MaterialWorld
See https://github.com/jelbourn/material2-app for an AoT implementation. I built this from the ground-up copying a lot of the core app instead of forking and refactoring.

This project was originally generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.17.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.

## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng --help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## UPDATES

- *01/21/2017* Modified to follow Angular guide for modularity and routing - similar to the final heroes app but using a dashboard instead of contacts.
- *01/02/2017* Updated to use angular-cli version 1.0.0-beta.26 and material 2.0.0-beta.1
